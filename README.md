# LSTAPI
The LonelyStars TimeAPI, made for WEBFISHING.

A mod API for synchronizing time related mods to a central source.

## The Problem
Right now WEBFISHING mods related to time rely on using the users real life time to remain synced with one another, the instant one tries to use an in-game time cycle the whole ship breaks apart. This fixes that.

## The Solution
Making one mod serve as the pseudo time that all others follow keeps them all synced to one source instead of each making up their own and therefore aren't synced with one another.
